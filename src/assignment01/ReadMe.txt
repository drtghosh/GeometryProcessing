Geometry Processing, Assignment 1
=================================

2D Delaunay triangulation & Voronoi diagrams

Place the folder containing this ReadMe next to the src/assignment00
folder from Practical Exercise 0 and rerun cmake in your build folder.
In your IDE select Assignment01 as the startup project.

What you should implement:
--------------------------

Fill in the missing lines of code in the file task.hh:

1) Test whether an edge is Delaunay or not by 
   implementing the circum-circle criterion.

2) Re-establish the Delaunay property after inserting
   a new vertex into the triangulation. Only perform the
   check on egdes where it is necessary. 


Hand in your solution:
--------------------------
1) Create a zip file containing a Members.txt and the files you changed 
   in the exercise. For this exercise you should only change and 
   upload task.cc together with the members file.

2) Upload the zip file to the Moodle.
